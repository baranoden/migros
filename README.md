Hey,
Gently type:`npm install` first,
then: create an `.env` file to main folder with this line of code:
`REACT_APP_LOCAL_IP=http://YOURLOCALIP:3000`

Lastly, change the firebase configuration from `~utils/firebase.ts`

### `npm start`

if doesnt work, restart your IDE. ( Sometimes dotenv needs to refrest it self.)
then repeat 8th line.
